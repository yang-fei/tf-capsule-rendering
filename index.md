This project builds capsule blocks in image-conditioned GAN (generative adversarial network) to learn the image translation from a plain image into a rendered image. A line preservation loss is implemented not only to constrain the line shapes, but also to improve the light effects around these lines at the same time.

## Dataset - HIDER
Home Interior Design Effect Rendering dataset

The dataset is under preparation. It will be released soon after ACCV2018. At this time, you can send your request to fei.yang@nottingham.edu.cn. We will inform you as soon as possible.  

The dataset contains 584 paris of images generated from 300 3D models. 

Some samples:
